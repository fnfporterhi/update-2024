soooo ive had a lot happen since ive been on github last.
im gonna list it bc it makes sense and my adhd likes it

1. sooo ive become a major guitar hero/rock band fan. ive actually got a whole modded xbox 360 to play the original games, and the modded ones.
2. ive been struggling recently with anxiety. ive started going to a therapist, and its helping a lot.
3. as yall have noticed, ive been taking long breaks here. "i wonder why? is he quitting?" HELL NAW! im never quitting. theres just nothing much to do fnf-wise, the game is dead, i dont have any ideas whatsoever. ill come up with some soon.

thank you guys for being with me, and for the support!

i love you all!

p.s if you wanna chat, or have a collab idea for a repo, please make an issue on this repo, and ill get to it ASAP!! ❤️❤️❤️
